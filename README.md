jiro or Jiro Template Language
====

At first this template language is inspired by doT. My goal is to inprove over doT in all posible places:
* Less in size;
* Simple to extend;
* Allow debugging (doT is very weak at this part);
* Allow more plugin's for improving development;
* Faster than doT or any similar templating engine for node.js and in browser usage.
